Bitcoin=E2=80=99s trajectory for 2023 has been clear and with a bullish und=
ertone. The flagship cryptocurrency kicked off the year with a strong bulli=
sh sentiment. The bitcoin price rose by 47% within the first month of the y=
ear, setting the tone for the following weeks.=20
=20
The cryptocurrency=E2=80=99s rise was characterized by typical declines, wi=
th support and resistance levels impacting the price change. Bitcoin=
=E2=80=99s price dropped to $19,569 in March after climbing over $25,000 fo=
r the first time since August 2022.=20
=20
Many Bitcoin analysts identified the climb above $25,000 as a significant m=
ove to confirm the end of the bear market. Despite the pullback after that,=
 the majority of Bitcoin=E2=80=99s proponents considered it a consolidation=
 and an accumulation opportunity. That belief was supported by the anticipa=
tion of a bull run ahead of the next Bitcoin halving, which comes up in 202=
4.=20
=20
Another phase of the bullish trend returned to the Bitcoin market in the mi=
ddle of March. Bitcoin gained over 58% in about four weeks during that peri=
od, as the price surpassed the $30,000 level for the first time since June =
2022.=20

After that surge, Bitcoin entered into another consolidation, pulling back =
toward the $25,000 support region. After reaching a local low of $24,756, t=
he bullish momentum returned, with the price returning above the $30,000 pr=
ice level.=20

Data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin=E2=80=99s price at the end of June=
 was $30,469, marking a yearly gain of over 83%. Bitcoin traded at $30,503 =
at the time of writing, with the positive momentum still intact.=20
