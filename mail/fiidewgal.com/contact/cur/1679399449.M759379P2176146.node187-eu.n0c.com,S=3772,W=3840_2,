We have hacked your website fiidewgal.com and extracted your databases. Thi=
s was due to the security holes you had in your your site/server which have=
 gained us remote control of pretty much everything that was on the server.=
=20

Our team is mostly interested in customer, administrative, and employee inf=
ormation which we have extracted through your databases once we got remote =
control over the server. It still needs to be sorted out but it will be wel=
l-organized once finished. First, we will be going through the emails/sms i=
nformation and contacting the recipient how you held in disregard about the=
ir information being exposed to a hacking group when you could have stopped=
 it. This would be detrimental to your personal image with these relationsh=
ips with these people. Lastly, now that we have information not only will w=
e be monetizing off it with our methods but made public or sold to other pe=
ople that will do whatever they wish with the information also after we are=
 done.

Now you can put a stop to this by paying a $3000 fee (0.11 BTC) in bitcoin =
to the address 3NqNPZtkSTySukkRvCqi8uZe3zMPSrnPP5 We will be notified of pa=
yment which we will then delete the information we have obtained, patch the=
 hole in the site/server which we got in and remove you from any future tar=
geting in the future. You have 72 hours in doing so after viewing this mess=
age or the series of steps will commence. You can obtain bitcoin through su=
ch services such as paxful.com or do a search on bing.com
